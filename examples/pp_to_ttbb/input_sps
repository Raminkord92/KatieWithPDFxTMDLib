# If you wish to sum over pdfs for processes with equivalent matrix elements,

#   partlumi = combined
# in this file. This is NOT SUITABLE to create event files for parton showers.
# Indicating quarks with q and r implies summation over initial-state pdfs.
# Indicating quarks with u d u~ d~ implies summation within up/down-type
# and within regular/anti-type, so for the case of electro-weak interactions.
# The cross section for each process is multiplied with the quantity "factor"
# on each process-line, for the summation over final-state partons.
# The next quantity indicates to which groups the process contributes in the
# case of multi-parton-interactions.
#
# The last quantity sets the number of desired non-QCD couplings in the
# amplitude, respectively of type:  electro-weak  higgs-gluon  higgs-photon
# Of course the necessary interactions need to be switched on in the
# user module.
